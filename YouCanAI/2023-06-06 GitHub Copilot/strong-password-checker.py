# Prompt:
# Complete the following code in python3. Given a string password, return the minimum number of steps required to make password strong. if password is already strong, return 0. 
# A password is considered strong if the below conditions are all met: 
#     It has at least 6 characters and at most 20 characters. 
#     It contains at least one lowercase letter, at least one uppercase letter, and at least one digit. 
#     It does not contain three repeating characters in a row (i.e., "Baaabb0" is weak, but "Baaba0" is strong). 
# Given a string password, return the minimum number of steps required to make password strong. if password is already strong, return 0. 
# In one step, you can: 
#     Insert one character to password, 
#     Delete one character from password, or 
#     Replace one character of password with another character. 
# Example 1: 
# Input: password = "a" 
# Output: 5 

# Example 2: 
# Input: password = "aA1" 
# Output: 3  

# Example 3: 
# Input: password = "1337C0d3" 
# Output: 0 

# Constraints: 
#     1 <= password.length <= 50 
#     password consists of letters, digits, dot '.' or exclamation mark '!'. 
# class Solution: 
#     def strongPasswordChecker(self, password: str) -> int: 

# Failed 

class Solution:
    def strongPasswordChecker(self, password: str) -> int:
        # check password length
        # check password for lowercase, uppercase, and digit
        # check password for repeatition
        # check password for consecutive characters
        # check password for special characters
        # check password for invalid characters
        # check password for invalid length
