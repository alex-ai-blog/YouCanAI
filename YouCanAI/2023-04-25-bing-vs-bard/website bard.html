      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>The Bakery was founded in 1972 by two brothers who had a passion for baking. They started out in a small shop in the heart of downtown, and quickly became known for their delicious pastries and breads. Over the years, the bakery has grown and expanded, but the brothers' commitment to quality and customer service has never wavered.</p>
      <p>Today, The Bakery is still family-owned and operated. We're proud to be a part of the community and we're committed to providing our customers with the best possible experience.</p>
