To build a professional-looking HTML homepage for a fictitious laptop retailer, I would start by creating an attractive layout that displays multiple laptops with their specifications and prices prominently on the page.

To display product features and pricing, I might create separate sections with headings like "Features" and "Prices," then use tables or div containers to organize each section. Each laptop could have its own row within these sections, complete with photos and specific technical details such as processor speed, storage capacity, battery life, etc.

Additionally, I can create a banner near the top of the page to draw attention to any sales currently happening at the store, using eye-catching graphics or animation effects to make them stand out more visually. This could include text explaining the promotion and encouraging visitors to browse around the site and take advantage of special discounted deals before they expire.

Finally, I would add links throughout the page to additional pages detailing shipping options, warranty policies, return procedures, and contact info for customers who need assistance shopping online or over the phone. By including all this essential information on the homepage itself, our fictional laptop retailer can provide easy access to everything potential buyers need to know, making it simple for them to shop confidently and secure great deals!
